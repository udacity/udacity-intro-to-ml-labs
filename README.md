# Intro to Machine Learning labs

Azure Machine Learning designer gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU. Azure Machine Learning designer also supports publishing models as web services on Azure Kubernetes Service that can easily be consumed by other applications. To use Azure Machine Learning designer, you do not need programming experience and this quickstart will walk you through an exercise that will show how to process training data, create a model, train, score, and evaluate the model and finally deploy the trained model as a web service.
